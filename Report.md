# Program design
The program starts with defining structs, firstly for the comments in the PPM File, which uses a linked list, secondly for a Pixel in a PPM File and lastly the PPM File contents itself. PPM Format was used as the link in the coursework specifications suggests. I used the main on top style as I learned it on the CS50 Course I completed

The first function getPPM is used to get the contents of the PPM File, it first checks if the file is in PPM Format, checking it includes P3, it then reads comments until it finds the new line character. The strcpy function is used to copy a string from the source to the destination which would be the first argument, for example the comments from the root node, are copied from the PPM File, the P3 beginning is copied using the strcpy function as well. It then uses fscanf to get the width height and max of the PPM File its reading. I decided to use malloc function to dynamically allocate memory during runtime for the size of the PPM. The function then scans for the RGB pixels and returns ppm.

The function showPPM was just used for testing to check whether it was reading the PPM File as I intended it to. It first outputs/prints the P3, then the width and height and then the max and the RGB values. Comments are read using the linked list based implementation where it starts from the root and uses nxt as a pointer to the next value in the list.

writePPMtofile is a function used to do what the name of the function suggests. It writes the PPM to file. It takes the ppm which will be used later in the encode function, and writes it to the fout output file. fprintf function is used to print directly to the file. The same linked list implementation for comments and then fprintf prints the width height max and RGB values into the new file.

encode function encodes a message into the red field of the PPM. The random number generator was suggested to me from the link (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_srand.htm). This random number generator is used to generate a key which will be encoded along with the message, the key will be used for allocating the pixels and during decode to reveal the message. Int start is used to figure out how many pixels will need the random numbers to be generated by finding a number from 0 to the total size of the PPM File. Next we go to the main part of the function which is encoding a message to the red pixels in the ppm file. A counter is used to read the message and encode the message into the red pixels of the PPM. It then returns the PPM

The decode function takes the original PPM File and the modified PPM File as inputs. Dynamic Memory allocation for decodedMsg is used because of dynamic nature of the message itself. We then look for int i which is less than the size of the original PPM if there is a discrepancy between the red pixel values in the first PPM and the second PPM. I also took account for the whitespaces found in the message. decodedMsg is then pointed to the newly allocated memory using realloc. Pointers for spaces and characters used once again. Once done it returns the decodedMsg.

The main function takes 3 arguments, the program name, the fin file and the fout file. If not an error message will be displayed asking the user for two arguments. Depending on context fout could mean the Output for encode or the Modified file in decode. Memory is allocated for the choice you wish to choose, User can use e for encode function and d for decode function.

The first choice 'e' uses fin to open and read the file, main function is made so that message cant be longer than size of PPM File. It asks for a message to be encoded and once input it uses the encode function to encode the message written to the original ppm. The writePPMtoFile method is used to then copy the contents of the original but now modified ppm into the output argument. Both files are then closed for manual garbage collection. A success message "Voila!" is then shown to signify that encoding process is complete.

If choice 'd' is selected fin reads the first input and fout reads the second input. getPPM method is used to get values of the two files, printf function is then used to output decoded message which is found using the decode function.Both files closed for manual garbage collection once again



# Choice of data structures and algorithms
Linked List Structure is used to read the comments in every function, it was more of a peace of mind choice as its easier to use. I have also used arrays abundantly too. Most of the functions are bare bones run of the mill code using loops to create the functions.
